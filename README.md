# FloweringRelatedGenes
Identify potential genes that are responsible for a flowering trait through an RNA-sequencing data analysis.

# Answer to Question 3
First of all, I will briefly talk about the high-throughput RNA sequencing method in a simple and understandable way by presenting some figures and flowcharts. I’ll try to explain what are the advantages and critical purposes of RNA-seq data analysis in general and in this specific study. Then, I’ll explain that, these days, by having the accurate, fast and affordable sequencing technologies as well as statistical tools with low complexity; multidisciplinary scientists such as bioinformaticians could joint plant breeders and make a team to recognize the differences among samples in an experiment in transcription level and identify the target gene(s) or gene sets  for further research. These genes could eventually consider for any plant breeding or genetic engineering purposes. Moreover, I’ll show them the RNA-seq data analysis results which I’ve done (Figure 1), such as heatmap (E) and volcano (D) plots and explain how/which genes are differentially up/down-expressed as well as look at the gene clusters that their expression patterns are the same and go over other plots in Figure 1 (A,B,C) to see some DE examples of the genes. It’s also possible to do the pathway and gene network analysis using GO and KEGG methods (annotation and gene symbol must be available for this species) and identify the differential expressed gene sets and hub genes in more functional terms and many more biological interpretation and conclusions that help a breeder to make the best decisions.
